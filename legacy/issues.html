<h1>Limitations and known issues</h1>

<p><em>This is the deprecated 1.0 version of ReMarkdown.<br>
See <a href="/code/remarkdown/">the current version</a>.</em></p>

<p>ReMarkdown was tested on recent versions of modern browsers. It works well in
all browsers with complete CSS 2.1 support, including IE8. It will degrade
not-so-gracefully in IE7.</p>

<h2>Browser-specific issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>IE8 does not render generated content in HR elements. Your horizontal
rules will be invisible in that browser.</li>
<li>IE8, in print mode, has trouble with the overflowing “>” signs of
blockquotes.</li>
<li>Spotted a few issues when printing in Firefox 4b on OSX. I opened two
bug reports and both were fixed (yay!), so Firefox 4 final should be ok.</li>
<li>Spotted a few minor issues when printing in Opera 11 on OSX.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Underlined headings</h2>

<p>To achieve the style of underlined H1 and H2 elements, I had to pick one of
the various CSS position schemes/behaviors/display modes/etc. that restrict
an element’s width to the width of its contents. All of the options I could
figure out had unwanted side effects. I settled for <code>display:inline-block</code>
but it’s far from a perfect solution. Two consequences:</p>

<ol>
<li>Spacing above and below titles may be off in a few configurations (issues
caused by the lack of margin collapsing).</li>
<li>Having two underlined headings in a row is dangerous. Typically, an
underlined H2 following an underlined H1 might end up on the same line.
So such H2 elements are switched back to <code>display:block</code> (a very dirty
fix).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ordered lists use a custom CSS counter, not the default counter. Only way
to change the counter style (from numeric to roman or something else) is
to change the CSS for “remarkdowned” OLs.</li>
<li>The start attribute of OL elements is ignored. If you know a way to use
it in a CSS counter, feel free to tell me.</li>
</ul>
