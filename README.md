# ReMarkdown.css — HTML that looks like Markdown text

See the [online demo and documentation](https://fvsch.github.io/remarkdown/).

## Building a custom ReMarkdown stylesheet

1.  [Download a zip of this repo](https://github.com/fvsch/remarkdown/archive/master.zip).
2.  Unzip and make modifications to `remarkdown.scss` (see the comments for details).
3.  Run `npm install && npm run build` (you will need to have Node.js installed for that).

Voilà, you should have a `remarkdown-custom.css` file now.
