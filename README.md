# ReMarkdown

ReMarkdown is a stylesheet that makes HTML look like raw Markdown text.
Take a look at the [online demo and documentation](https://fvsch.github.io/remarkdown/).

Markdown is [a plain-text syntax by John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). This project also takes inspiration from variants such as PHP Markdown Extra and GitHub Flavored Markdown.

## Building a custom ReMarkdown stylesheet

1. [Download a zip of this repo](https://github.com/fvsch/remarkdown/archive/master.zip).
2. Unzip and make modifications to `remarkdown.scss` (see the comments for details).
3. Run `npm install && npm run build` (you will need to have Node.js installed for that).

Voil√†, you should have a `remarkdown-custom.css` file now.
